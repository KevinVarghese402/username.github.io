					<p>Hi, I’m Kevin Varghese — an emerging game developer with a deep love with games.
My journey with games began at a young age, not just through playing them and loving every minute, but through appreciating the work happening behind the scenes. The creativity of each aspect drove me to  go into making a game are what inspired me to pursue game development myself.
In any situation, i am adaptable. Whether that means that handling documentation and presentation, supporting programming tasks, helping with group organization and expectation. I believe that every role contributes to the bigger picture, and I am  always ready to step where I am needed  
Teamwork is one of my core strengths. I value understanding my teammates’ skills so we can deliver a project efficiently and within scope. I also enjoy helping others grow, turning weaknesses into strengths through communication and shared learning. And at the end make sure that my skills can be refined and always be improved.
I’m continually improving as a developer and teammate, and I’m excited to contribute to meaningful and well-crafted projects.</p>

					<span class="image main"><img src="images/Uni6.jpg" alt="" /></span>
					<p>Hello there, im <strong>Kevin Varghese </strong> 
						Im 21 years old with the aim of finishing my <strong>Bachelor of Game Design at SAE University College Brisbane</strong>
						I always had a love for games and even when playng the bad ones I still found the appreciation of the work that goes
						behind these. And becoming a developer it definetly strengthened that view. 
						My favourite Genres being
						<ul>
   						 	<li>First Person Shooters - Games being like Marvel Rivals, RoboCop: RogueCity</li>
    						<li>Deep Story games - such as Ghost of Tsushima, Red Dead Redemtion 1/2</li>
							<li>Dark Fantasy - Like Darksouls and seeing the beauty in its dark world
    						<li>Open world - link Breath of the wild, Skyrim, Shadow of Mordor </li>
						</ul>
						I have met alot of wonderful people, people ranging with different skill sets. These people have shown how their skill
						are formed but also used and again allowing me to increase my skill, while having a deeper appreciation for games
						and its different elements.

    					<img src="images/Uni4.png" alt="Photo4">
					</div>

						With the different skills and the collaberation of others, the confidence gained
						the games will reach a new level of creativity, depth and of course fun. Each project, teaches
						me something new, the collaberations with others will keep pushing me forward to reach 
						the level of entertainment I want. 
					</p>
					
					<p><strong>My Skills</strong></p>

					<p>
						Throughout the gaming journey my skills have improved and has been used in several fields such as
					<ul>
   						 	<li>I have done management for multiple projects - 
								becoming project manger, making timetables, regulating project tasks to make it even and fair for others, 
								made sure that expectations where made so that game would come out on expected time.   
							</li>
							<Li> I have been the main programmer on projects - working on the game game elements of the project
								such as movement or upgrades such as being the programmer for "Endless Summer" as my teammate 
								was not availble.
							</Li>
							<LI> Recently been improving my artistic abilities as well, as for the most recent project
								"Eclipse Reborn", I am the artist that is behind all the assets making sure that the 
								world and assets are all up to standard with the main project owner.
					</ul>
